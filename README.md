# le_cryptography


Codes and ciphers are really fun, not only to crack but to implement as well.

This repo aims to include code written in `Python` and/or `Matlab` of various types of simple ciphers.

The code will be written and based in English, this is an important note because the frequency analysis implemented here is thus solely based on the English language.

## Types of Ciphers
---------

### Monoalphabetic Ciphers
* Caesar Cipher
* Atbash Cipher
* Keyword Cipher
* Polybius Square

### Polyalphabetic Ciphers
* Vigenere Cipher
* Beaufort Cipher
* Autokey Cipher
* Running Key Cipher

## Codebase expansion
------
The following ciphers will be coded once all the alphabetic ciphers have been attempted:

### Polygraphic Ciphers
* Playfair Cipher
* Bifid Cipher
* Trifid Cipher
* Four-square Cipher

### Transposition Ciphers
* Rail Fence
* Route Cipher
* Columnar Transposition
